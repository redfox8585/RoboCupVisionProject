This program uses the Qt framework https://www.qt.io/download-open-source.
You need to install the Qt Creator IDE too, to compile the program.

Two files named "ballPositions.json" and "simulation.json" must be placed next to the executable.
"ballPositions.json" is gerenated by the image analysis program and "simulation.json" is the output of the javascript/html simulation.
